    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Belly: This is an ideal cut for sinigang because the fat keeps the meat moist and tender, enhancing the dishâ€™s flavor. You can also use pork shoulder, spare ribs, or neck bones.</li>
        <li>Young Tamarind: For a sour soup, stick with young tamarind. Combining young and ripe tamarind can add a subtle sweetness if desired.</li>
        <li>Daikon Radish: While optional, daikon radish adds a unique texture and flavor to the dish.</li>
        <li>Taro (Gabi): Adding taro makes the soup thicker and creates a variation known as sinigang na baboy with gabi.</li>
    </ul>
